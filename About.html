		D Phenomenon 
		<blockquote>
		(born Divyansh) was born on 26 September 1999. He was raised in Amritsar, Punjab and moved to British Columbia at the age 18. He says he always enjoyed the scenes at the studio in videos and behind the scene was so tempting that he wanted to make his own music. He says one of the U.K. based music director 'Manni Sandhu' has been a great inspiration for his music. He began his passion for music at age 15 after watching the video of a track "Balle Balle by Ashok Gill ft. Manni Sandhu", says D Phenomenon. He released his first mix tape album in year 2015. After getting much media and social attention on the internet, he met with the owners of 'Creatorz Villa films' (now Xero Creators). They began producing a track together, called "Taur Jatt Di" which was admired all over the world. With great responses from countries like U.K., India, Canada, Australia and U.S.A. He is currently working and can be reached via this website or the Instagram.
